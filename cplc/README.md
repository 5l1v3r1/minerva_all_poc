# Minerva - CPLC checker

The Minerva CPLC checker uses the Card Production Life Cycle (CPLC) data present on
cards under the GlobalPlatform standard to identify vulnerable cards based on a list of
known or suspected vulnerable devices.

To run this tool, install the Python requirements from the `requirements.txt` file,
then simply insert the tested card into your reader and run the `check.py` script.
